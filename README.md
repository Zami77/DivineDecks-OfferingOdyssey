# Divine Decks: Offering Odyssey
[Play on itch.io!](https://yatchstudios.itch.io/divine-decks-offering-odyssey)

Make your cards last, in this one time use card battler!

In Divine Decks, you start out with a deck of cards, where each card can only be used once. Use your cards efficiently to make it to the end and give an offering of your remaining cards to the Gods. Good luck!

This game was made for 1-Bit Jam #2.

The limitation was to start with everything and end with nothing.
