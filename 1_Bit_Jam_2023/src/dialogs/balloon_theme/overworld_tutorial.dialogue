Every 100 years, someone from your village must make an offering to the Gods.
This year, you've been chosen.
Defeat the monsters along the trail to get to the sacred temple to make your offering.
You can always view what cards remain in your deck by clicking the view deck button.
Keep in mind, each card is one time use only.
